<p>The amount of sea ice in the arctic varies seasonally and for the year 2018 it can be modelled by the cubic function $A(m) = 0.069x^3 - 1.3x^2 + 6.04x + 6.73$ where $m$ represents the month (January is month 1 and December is month 12) and $A$ represents the area of the sea ice in millions of square kilometers.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Sketch the function describing the extent of sea ice. Label the axes appropriatelly. </li>
  <li>Determine the maximum area of sea ice coverage to the nearest thousand of a million square kilometer.</li>
  <li>Determine the minimum area of sea ice coverage to the nearest thousand of a million square kilometer.</li>
  <li>Determine during which month the the sea ice covers the largest area.</li>
  <li>Determine during which month the the sea ice covers the smallest area.</li>
  <li>What is an appropriate domain and range for this context? Round quantities to the nearest thousand if necessary</li>
  <!--<li>The total land area of Canada is 9093507 $\mbox{km}^2$. Determine for how many months in 2018 the area of the sea ice in the Arctic was large than the land area of Canada.</li>-->

<h3>A.</h3>
<img src="http://maythemathbewithyou.com/tex/seasonl-sea-ice-extent.png">
<h3>B.</h3>
Maximum sea ice area $= 15.017$ million km$^2$.
<h3>C.</h3>
Minimum sea ice area $= 5.944$ million km$^2$.
<h3>D.</h3>
The x-coordinate of the maximum is 3.076..., hence during March the sea ice covered the largest area.
<h3>E.</h3>
The x-coordinate of the minimum is 9.483..., hence during September the sea ice covered the smallest area.
<h3>F.</h3>
Domain: ${m | 1 \leq m \leq 12, x \in R}$ or $[1,12]$ and Range: ${A | 0 \leq A \leq 15, A \in R}$ or $[0, 15]$. Other answers are possible.
<!--<h3>G.</h3>
Graph $A(m)$ and add a horizontal line as second function $Y_2=9.093507$. Determine the m-coordinates of the points of intersection of the two functions. The m-xoordinates of the points of intersection are $m_1=6.94...$ and $m_2=11.47$, so the sea ice area was larger than the land area of Canada between January and end on June (month 6) and between mid November (month 11) and December 31.-->
