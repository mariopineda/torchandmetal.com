Determine the polynomial that would have to be added to $6x^2-3x+6$ so that the sum of the polynomials is $x^2+4x+2$.</li>

<!-- Determine the values of $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ so that the following is true, $(2t^3-at^2-4bt-6)-(ct^3+4t^2+7t+1) = 4t^3-5t^2-15t+d$. -->

{% capture solution %}
\[
  \begin{array}{cl}
      & (x^2+4x+2)-(6x^2-3x+6) \\
    = & x^2+4x+2-6x^2+3x-6 \\
    = & -5x^2+7x-4
  \end{array}
\]
