<p>A farmer is planing to put a fence around a rectangular field. The area of the field, in square metres, can be represented by the expression $18a^2-2$ and the width of the field is $3a+1$ metres.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Write and simplify an expression for the length of the field.</li>
  <li>If the farmer requires 88 m of fencing, determine the value of $a$ and the length and width of the field.</li>
</ol>
