<p>You are playing fetch with your dog and throw a ball vertically upward. You record the height of the ball above the ground at half-second intervals for the first three seconds. The data is shown in the following table.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Using an appropriate regression function, determine the equation describing the height of the ball as a function of time. Round parameters to the nearest hundreth. Justify your choice of regression function.</li>
      <li>Determine the maximum height of the ball above the ground. Is this an extrapolation or interpolation? Explain.</li>
      <li>Determine, to the nearest tenth of a second, the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground. Is this an extrapolation or interpolation? Explain.</li>
      <li> Determine the domain and range of the regression function in this context.</li>
      <li>As you throw the ball it catches the attention of your dog and she starts running towards the ball and jumps into the air try to catch the it. 4.4 seconds after you threw thew ball your dog jumps up reaching a hight of 2.5 metres. Is she high enough to catch the ball?</li>
