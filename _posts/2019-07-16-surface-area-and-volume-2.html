<ol type="A">
  <li>Sparky the dog is tied to a pole in the middle of the yard using a 8 ft leash. Sparky has ruined the grass in the area that his leash has allowed him access to. This area will need to be reseeded. Grass seed costs \$2.50 per package and one package covers 50 ft$^2$. What will it cost to reseed the yard?</li>
  <li>The surface area of a cube is 70 cm$^2$. Determine the volume of the cube, to the nearest tenth.</li>
</ol>

  <h3>A.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The area of the yard that Sparky has access to is a circle with a 8 ft radius. The area of this circle is $A=\pi r^2 = \pi 8^2=201.06...$ ft$^2$.</li>
      <li>Each package of seed covers 50 ft$^2$ so the number of packages required to seed the damaged area is $\frac{\displaystyle 201.06...}{\displaystyle 50} = 4.02... \approx 4$ packages. Alternativelly, since we need slightly more than 4 packages we could round up to 5 packages.</li>
      <li>Each package costs \$2.50 so the total cost of $4.02...$ packages will be $2.50 \times 4.02...=10.05...\approx 10$ dollars. If we rounded the number of packages up to 5 then the cost would be $2.50 \times 5 = 12.50$ dollars. Either answer is acceptable as long as your reasoning is explained.</li>
      <li>A cat would never ruin your lawn.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>B.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The formula for calculating the suface area of a cube is $SA=6x^2$, since we know $SA=70$ cm$^2$ we can calculate the side length of the cube by substituting in the surface area and solve for $x$, $70=6x^2 \Rightarrow \frac{\displaystyle 70}{\displaystyle 6} = x^2 \Rightarrow x = \sqrt{\frac{\displaystyle 70}{\displaystyle 6}} \Rightarrow x = 3.41...$ cm</li>
    <li>The formula for calculating the volume of a cube is $V=x^3$. We subsitute in the side length, $V=3.41...^3=39.84... \approx 39.9$ cm$^3$.
