<p>Consider the periodic function $f(x) = 15.3 \sin (\pi x)$
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Explain how to determine a graphing window that will show at least three complete periods of $f(x)$, starting from $x=0$.</li>
    <li>Graph three complete cycles using your graphing calculator and state the window settings used.</li>
    <li>Determine, to the nearest tenth, the value of the function when $x=4.5$.</li>
    <li>Determine, to the nearest hundreth, two values of $x$ between 3 and 4 for which $f(x)=-8.5.$.</li>
  </ol>
