<p>
  Given the following conjecture: "The sum of two prime numbers is an even number".
  <ul>
    <li>Provide an example supporting this conjecture.</li>
    <li>Provide a counter example showing that the conjecture is false.</li>
    <li>Revise the conjecture so it holds true for prime numbers.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

{% capture solution %}
<h3>A.</h3>
<p>For example: $3+5=9$, $5+7=12$, etc.</p>
<h3>B.</h3>
<p>$2+3=5$, 5 is an odd number.</p>
<h3>C.</h3>
<p>The sum of two prime numbers, which are not 2, is an even nuber.</p>
