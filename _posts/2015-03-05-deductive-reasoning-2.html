<p>Use deductive reasoning to prove that the sum of three consecutive even numbers is divisible by six.</p>

{% capture solution %}
  <p>If $n$ is a whole number, then $2n$ is an even number and $2n+(2n+2)+(2n+4)+(2n+6)+(2n+8)+(2n+10)$ is a sum of six consequtive even numbers. This expression can be simplified to: $12n+30 = 6(2n+5)$. Since we were able to factor out 6 it means the sum must be divisible by 6.</p>
