<ol type="A">
  <li>A scuba diver is 20 metres below the surface of the water 12 seconds after diving into the water and 50 meters below the surface after 25 seconds. Determine the scuba diver's rate of change, to the nearest tenth.</li>
  <li>The temperature of a glass of milk changes from 20$^{\circ}$C to 45$^{\circ}$C in the course of 6 minutes. Determine the rate of change in temperature, to the nearest tenth.</li>
</ol>

  Note. In this course a time variable, e.g. seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, seasons, months, etc., will always be the independent variable.
  <h3>A.</h3>
  <p>The scuba diver's rate of change in depth (dependent variable) as a function of time (independent variable) is given by the slope of the linear relation, $m=\frac{\displaystyle 50-20}{\displaystyle 25-12} = \frac{\displaystyle 30}{\displaystyle 13} \approx 2.3$ metres/second.</p>

  <h3>B.</h3>
  <p>The rate of change of the temperature (dependent variable) as a function of time (independent variable) is given by the slope of the linear relation, $m=\frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}} = \frac{\displaystyle 25}{\displaystyle 6} \approx 4.2 ^\circ$C/minute.</p>
