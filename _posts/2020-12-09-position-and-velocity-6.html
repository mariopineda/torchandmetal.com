<p>A car, moving at an initial speed of 20 m/s, has its breaks applied and begins to slow down. The position function for its motion is $s(t) = 20t-2t^2$, $0 \leq t \leq 5$.</p>

<!-- Two column template -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="mt-3 col-md-6">
      <h4>A.</h4>
      Determine the braking distance (to when it comes to rest).
    </div>

    <div class="mt-3 col-md-6">
      <h4>B.</h4>
      Determine the speed of the car when it has braked a distance of 42 m.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
