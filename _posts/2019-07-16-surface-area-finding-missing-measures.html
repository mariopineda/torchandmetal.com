  <li>A box has a surface area of 432 cm$^2$. Its length and width are 8 cm and 6 cm respectivelly. What is its height, rounded to the nearest whole number?</li>
  <li>A cylinder has a surface area of 1800 mm$^2$ and a radius of 12 mm. What is its height, rounded to the nearest hundreth?</li>
  <li>A square-based pyramid has a surface area of 129.5 in$^2$. The length of its base is 4.5 in. What is its slant height, rounded to the nearest hundreth?</li>
  <li>An ice cream cone has a surface area of 198.6 cm$^2$. The diameter of the cone is 10.2 cm. What is the slant height of the cone, rounded to the nearest tenth?</li>
  <li>The surface area of a cone is 400.2 ft$^2$. The radius of the cone is 6.0 ft. Determine the slant height of the cone, rounded to the nearest tenth?</li>
