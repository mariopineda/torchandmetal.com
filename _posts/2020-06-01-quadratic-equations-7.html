<p>Rachel is putting up a fence around the rectangular pasture where her horse Jason is grazing. She has 150 ft of fencing material and the pasture will have an area of 2808 ft$^2$. She needs to determine the dimensions of the enclosure.</p>

<p>Let $w$ represent the width of the enclosure. Into the area formula for a rectangle $A=l \times w$, substitute $A=2808$ and $l=150-2w$ to obtain the following equation $2808=(150-2w)w$.</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Express the equation in standard form as $aw^2+bw+c=0$.</li>
  <li>Use the quadratic formula to solve for $w$.</li>
  <li>What are the dimensions of the pasture were Jason is grazing?</li>
</ol>
