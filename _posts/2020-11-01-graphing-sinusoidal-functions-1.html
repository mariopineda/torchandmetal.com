<!-- Note: This problem should be renamed Angular Measures 2, but a new video wold have to be recorded since the title appears in the solution video -->

<p>Complete a table of values for $y=\cos{x}$ for the domain $0^{\circ} \leq x \leq 360^{\circ}$. Give your answers to two decimal places when necessary. Plot the points. Graph $y=\cos{x}$ on your graphing calculator using the following window settings: $X:[-360,540,30]$ and $Y:[-1.2,1.2,0.2]$ and complete the graph by joining the points.</p>
