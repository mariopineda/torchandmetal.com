<p>Consider the following periodic function $f(x) = 15.3 \sin{(\pi x)}$.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Explain how to determine a graphing window that will show at least three complete periods of $f(x)$, starting from $x=0$.</li>
  <li>Sketch three complete cycles and state thew window settings.</li>
  <li>Determine, to the nearest tenth, the value of the function when $x=4.5$.</li>
  <li>Determine, to the nearest hundreth, the values of $x$ between 3 and 4 for which $f(x)=-8.5$.
</ol>
