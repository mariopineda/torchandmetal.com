<p>A country's population is increasing at an annual rate of 2.2%. The current population is approximatelly 14 million. The growth in population can be modelled by the exponential function $P=P_0(1.022)^t$, $t$ is the number of years since the population was $P_0$. Assuming the population growth continues at the same rate,</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>determine, to the nearest million, the approximate population 6 years from now</li>
  <li>determine the number of complete years required for the population to double.</li>
  <li>Suggest an appropriate domain and range within the context of this problem.</li>
</ol>
