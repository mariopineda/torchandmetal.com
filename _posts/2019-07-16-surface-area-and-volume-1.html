    <p>The Trans Mountain Pipeline starts at the Edmonton Terminal located between Sherwood Park and Edmonton. Twenty feeder pipelines from throughout Alberta arrive at the terminal carrying both crude and processed oil. Oil is temporarily stored at the Edmonton Terminal before it is sent to other destinations, e.g. to the United States or to shipping terminals in BC. </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Using the vehicle in front of the tank as a referent estimate the height of the tank to the nearest metre. Assume the vehicle is 1.6 metres high at its highest point.</li>
      <li>The storage tanks are cylindrical in shape, painted white and with the roof covered in gravel or unpainted metal sheeting. Determine the surface area of one storage tanks if its diamater is 50 m. Round your answer to the nearest metre.</li>
      <li>Determine the amount of paint required to paint all the storage tanks in the satellite picture. Assume all the tanks have the same surface area. Each tank needs to be painted with two coats of white colour. One litre of paint covers 100 m$^2$.</li>

  <h3>A.</h3>
  <p>The storage tank is approximatelly 7 vehicles high, $7 \times 1.6 = 11.2 \approx 11$ metres high. Other answers are possible.</p>
