<p>Use deductive reasoning to prove that the sum of three consecutive integers is a multiple of three.</p>

{% capture solution %}
  <p>If $x$ is a integer, then $x+1$ is the first consecutive integer and $x+2$ the second consecutive integer. The sum of three consecutive integers can then be expressed as $x+(x+1)+(x+2) = 3x+3 = 3(x+1)$. Since $x+1$ is multiplied by 3 it means it is a multiple of 3.</p>
