<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) the increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as a result of the burning of fossil fuels can be modeled by the function $C(x) = 353(1.006)^{x-1990}$ where $C(x)$ is the concentration of CO2 in earth's atmosphere in parts per million (ppm) and $x$ is the year.</p>

<ol type=A>
  <li>Based on air bubbles trapped in mile-thick ice cores (and other paleoclimate evidence), we know that during the ice age cycles of the past 800000 years, carbon dioxide never exceeded 300 ppm. Following the Industrial Revolution (starting mid-1700s) the concentration of CO2 has rapidly risen above this historical maximum. Determine in what year the atmospheric CO2 concentration reached the historical maximum of 300 ppm. Round your answer to the nearest year.</li>
  <li>Determine how many percent higher the CO2 concentration is today compared to the historical maximum of 300 ppm.</li>

          <p>Set $x=2019$, $C(x) = 353(1.006)^{2019-1990}$, $C(x)=419.87\ldots$. Calculate the percent increase, $\left( \displaystyle\frac{419.87\ldots}{300} -1 \right) \times 100 = 39.95\ldots \approx 40%$. The atmospheric CO2 concentration is 40% higher in 2019 than the historical maximum.</p>
