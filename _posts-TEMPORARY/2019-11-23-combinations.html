  <p>As an athlete on a plant-based diet you need to ensure an adequate protein intake. The following are some plant-based high-protein sources.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Soy-based sources of protein:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>tempeh</li>
      <li>tofu</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Legume-based sources of protein:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>dal</li>
      <li>black beans</li>
      <li>hummus</li>
      <li>kidney beans</li>
      <li>black lentils</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Nut/seed-bases sources of protein:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>walnuts</li>
      <li>cashews</li>
      <li>chia seeds</li>
      <li>hemp hearts</li>
      <li>flax seeds </li>
      <li>sesame seeds</li>
      <li>pistachios</li>
      <li>pumpkin seeds</li>
      <li>sunflower seeds</li>

      <li>Your coach has instructed you that your post-workout meal has to contain 1 soy-based source of protein, 2 different legume-based proteins, and three different nut/seed-based sources of protein. How many different meals can you put together?</li>
      <li>Nuts and seeds are great as a high-protein trail mix for snacking. How many different trails mixes can you prepare that includes at least 6 different nut/seed-based sources of protein?</li>
      <li>How many different trails mixes can you prepare that includes at most 3 different nut/seed-based sources of protein?</li>

          <h3>A.</h3>
          <p>The order of the different dishes does not matter. 1 soy-based source of protein and 2 different legume-based proteins and three different nut/seed-based sources of protein ('and' means multiplication). $\binom{2}{1} \times \binom{5}{2} \times \binom{9}{3} = 2 \times 10 \times 84 = 1680$ different post-workout meals.</p>

          <h3>B.</h3>
          There are 9 nut/seed-based protein sources and the trail mix can consist of 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 of these ('or' means addition); $\binom{9}{6} + \binom{9}{7} + \binom{9}{8} + \binom{9}{9}= 84 + 36 + 9 + 1 = 130$ different trail mixes.

          <h3>C.</h3>
          The trail mix can consist of 1, 2 or 3 of these; $\binom{9}{1} + \binom{9}{2} + \binom{9}{3} = 9 + 36 + 84 = 129$ different trail mixes.
