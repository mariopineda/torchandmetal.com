<p>Climate change is one of the most important environmental issues of our time. Climate change is caused by the increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These increases are primarily due to human activities such as the use of fossil fuels or agriculture.  In 2017, the oil and gas sector was the largest source of GHG emissions in Canada, accounting for 27% of total national emissions. The following table summarizes the carbon dioxide emissions from the Alberta oil sands between 1990 and 2017.</p>
