          <h3>A.</h3>
          <p>Solve $\ln (1-P) = -0.0034-0.0053x$ for $P$ by converting to exponential form, $e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}=1-P$. Add $P$ to both sides, $e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}+P=1$ and subtract the power term from both sides, $P(x)=1-e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}$.</p>

          <h3>B.</h3>
          <p>Window settings: $X:[0,1000,100]$, $Y:[0,1,0.1]$</p>
          <img src="http://maythemathbewithyou.com/calculator/co2-emission-tax.png" width=50%>

          <h3>C.</h3>
          <p>The x-axis represents the tax per ton of carbon emitted into the atmosphere ($/ton). The y-axis represents the reduction of emissions as a percentage in decimal form.</p>

          <h3>D.</h3>
          $P(60)=1-e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}$, $P(60) = 0.274\ldots$, multiply by 100 to obtain the percent, $0.274\ldots \times 100 = 27$% reduction in carbon emissions.

          <h3>E.</h3>
          $P(x)=0.5 \Rightarrow x=130$. With a carbon levy of 130dollars/ton the model predicts that the carbon emissions will be reduced by 50%.

          <h3>F.</h3>
          <p>The graph is initially steep and then "flattens out", this means that small to moderate increases in the carbon levy will have a large effect on the carbon emissions (large reduction), while the same increase once the carbon levy already is hight will have less of an effect on the emissions. The relation between amount of carbon tax and emission reductions represents diminishing returns.</p>
