<p>Large volumes of tailings are a byproduct of bitumen extraction from the oil sands and managing these tailings is one of the most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry. Currently, tailing ponds are used to store the toxic bitumen byproducts produced by the oil sands mining. The Mildred Lake Settling Basin is a tailing pond located 40 km north of Fort McMurry and is the largest dam in the world. </p>

<p>Use the information provided in the Google satellite image to estimate the length of Mildred Lake. 1 km = 1000 m and 1 m = 100 cm. Round your answer to the nearest kilometer.</p>

          LSF = $1:159130$, new = 11.5 cm and old = x. $\displaystyle\frac{1}{159130} = \displaystyle\frac{11.5}{x} \Rightarrow$ $x = 11.5 \times 159130$, $x = 1829995$ cm. Convert to kilometers $1829995 \div 1000 \div 100 = 18.29995$ km $\approx 18$ km.
