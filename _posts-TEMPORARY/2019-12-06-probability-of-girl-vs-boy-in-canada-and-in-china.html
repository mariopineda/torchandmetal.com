<p>Across the world there are differences in the sex ratio at different life stages. This imbalance in the male and female population can in some cases be traced back to birth: in some countries the number of boys and girls born each year is significantly skewed. In the absence of selective abortion practices, births in a given population are typically male-biased â€“ the chances of having a boy are very slightly higher than having a girl. The sex ratio at birth refers to male births per female births. In 2017 there was 105.6 male births for every 100 female births in Canada. In the same year, there was 115 male births for every 100 female births in China.
