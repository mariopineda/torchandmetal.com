<p>A store sells a case of a dozen water bottles for $\$8.50$ and individual bottles of the same brand of water for $\$1.55$.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>A. How much does each bottle of water in the case of 12 cost? Round your answer to the nearest tenth.</li>
<li>B. How much would you save by buying a case of water, rather than 12 individual bottles?</li>
</ul>

{% capture solution %}
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>A. The unit price for a bottle is $\displaystyle\frac{\mbox{cost for the case}}{\mbox{number of bottles}} = \frac{8.50}{12} = 0.708\bar{3} \approx 0.71$. Each bottle costs $\$0.71$.</li>
  <li>B. The cost of 12 individual bottles is $1.55 \times 12 = 18.6$. You would save $\$10.10$ buying the case of 12 bottles rather than 12 individual bottles ($18.6 - 8.50 = 10.1$).</li>
  </ul>
