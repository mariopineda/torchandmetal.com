<p>There are 6 white socks, 4 black socks, and 10 brown socks in a clothes dryer. Without looking you select one sock at a time until you have 2 socks that are the same colour. How many socks must you randomly select from the clothes dryer to guarantee that you have 2 socks of the same colour but not white?</p>

{% capture solution %}
You need to pick 9 socks to be guaranteed to have 2 socks of the same colour. Worst case scenario: if you by chance picks all 6 white socks first followed by the next two socks (That's 8 socks so far) being black and brown (i.e. not a match.) you will have to pick one more sock (a 9th sock) to get a pair of matching socks (either two brown or two black socks). The 9th sock will be either black or brown (since all the white socks are gone).  Either one will yield a pair with one of the previous two socks.
