<p>Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms.<p>

<p>Since 1993 scientific satellites have accuratelly measured sea levels changes. Data from these satellite shows that the sea levels have risen by 94.4 mm (as of May 2019). Determine the average rate of change, to the nearest tenth, in the sea level during this time period in mm / year. </p>

          <p>If point $A(1993,0)$ and point $B(2019,94.4)$ then we can determine the slope using the slope formula $m = \displaystyle\frac{99.4-0}{2019-1993} = \displaystyle\frac{99.4}{26} = 3.8$ mm/year. The average rate of sea level raise since 1993 is 3.8 mm/year.</p>
