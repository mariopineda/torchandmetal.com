<p>All major tropical rainforests, including those in the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia and Indonesia, are disappearing to make way for human food production such as livestock and crops. The destruction of tropical rain forests has profound and devastating consequences that affect the whole world in many different ways, including giving rise to social conflict, human rights abuse, resulting in extinction of plants and animals and contributing to climate change.</p>

<p>The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world representing over half of Earth's tropical rainforests. More species are found here than anywhere else on Earth. Large areas of the Amazon forest is clearcut every year and converted to cattle ranching to produce meat and leather for the international market. Since 1970, 20% (792051 km$^2$, about the area of Pakistan) of the Amazon rainforest has disappeared. In 2017, 3315849 km$^2$ of the Amazon rainforest located in Brazil remained. Over the next year 7900 km$^2$ of the rainforest was logged and burned reducing the area to 3307949 km$^2$ in 2018.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Determine the common ratio, to the nearest thousandth, for the years 2017 and 2018.</li>
  <li>Determine the rate, to the nearest thousandth, at which the area of the rainforest is decreasing.</li>
  <li>Write the exponential equation that represents this situation, where $A(t)$ is the area of the forest cover in square kilometers in year $t$, where $t$ is the number of years from 2018.</li>
  <li>Using your model, predict the area of the forest that will remain in 2030. Round your answer to the nearest whole square kilometer.</li>
  <li>Calculate the total area, to the nearest square kilometer, of forest lost between 2019 and 2020.</li>
</ol>
