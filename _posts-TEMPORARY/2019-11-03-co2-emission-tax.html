<p>William Nordhaus is an American economist, best known for his work in economic modelling and climate change. Nordhaus recieved the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for developing a model describing the interplay between the economy and the climate.</p>

<p>One action that governments could take to reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere is to levy a tax on fossil fuel. This tax would be based on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the air when burning fossil fuels. The cost-benefit equation $\ln (1-P) = -0.0034-0.0053x$ models the approximate relationship between a tax of $x$ dollars per ton of carbon emissions and the corresponding percent reduction $P$ (in decimal form) </p>

<ol type=A>
  <li>Write $P$ as a function of $x$ (algebraically solve for $P$).</li>
  <li>Graph $P$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1000$ using appropriate window settings. What window settings are you using?</li>
  <li>What does the x and y-axis represent?</li>
  <li>Determine the carbon emission reduction that the model predicts, to the nearest whole percent, when the cost for carbon emissions are $60 per ton.</li>
  <li>What cost per ton would give a 50% reduction in carbon emissions. Round to nearest whole dollar.</li>
  <li>Using the graph of the model, discuss the benefits and disadvantages of continuing to raise taxes on carbon emissions.</li>
</ol>

          <h3>A.</h3>
          <p>Solve $\ln (1-P) = -0.0034-0.0053x$ for $P$ by converting to exponential form, $e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}=1-P$. Add $P$ to both sides, $e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}+P=1$ and subtract the power term from both sides, $P(x)=1-e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}$.</p>

          <h3>B.</h3>
          <p>Window settings: $X:[0,1000,100]$, $Y:[0,1,0.1]$</p>
          <img src="http://maythemathbewithyou.com/calculator/co2-emission-tax.png" width=50%>

          <h3>C.</h3>
          <p>The x-axis represents the tax per ton of carbon emitted into the atmosphere ($/ton). The y-axis represents the reduction of emissions as a percentage in decimal form.</p>

          <h3>D.</h3>
          $P(60)=1-e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}$, $P(60) = 0.274\ldots$, multiply by 100 to obtain the percent, $0.274\ldots \times 100 = 27$% reduction in carbon emissions.

          <h3>E.</h3>
          $P(x)=0.5 \Rightarrow x=130$. With a carbon levy of 130dollars/ton the model predicts that the carbon emissions will be reduced by 50%.

          <h3>F.</h3>
          <p>The graph is initially steep and then "flattens out", this means that small to moderate increases in the carbon levy will have a large effect on the carbon emissions (large reduction), while the same increase once the carbon levy already is hight will have less of an effect on the emissions. The relation between amount of carbon tax and emission reductions represents diminishing returns.</p>
