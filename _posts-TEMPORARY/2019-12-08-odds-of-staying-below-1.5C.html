<p>The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR1.5) was published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on 8 October 2018. The report predicts the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and includes over 6000 scientific references, and was prepared by 91 authors from 40 countries. Its key finding is that meeting a 1.5 °C target is possible but would require immediate "deep emissions reductions" and "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society." The report estimates that, if the necessary reductions in green house gas emissions are done, there is a 66% probability of staying below global warming of 1.5 °C.</p>
