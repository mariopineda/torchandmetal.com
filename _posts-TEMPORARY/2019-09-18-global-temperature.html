<p>Ever since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when humans started burning fossil fuels for energy, the world has been getting warmer. This warming has accelerated in recent decades as we continue increasing our use of fossil fuels. Eighteen of the 19 warmest years all have occurred since 2001, with 2016 ranking as the warmest on record. The global temperature record measures the average temperature over the entire surface of the planet. The temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter). But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space — quantities that change very little. The amount of energy radiated by the Earth depends on the chemical composition of the atmosphere, particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.</p>

<p>The temperature index in following table summarizes the global surface temperature since 1959 relative to pre-industrial levels.</p>

      <li>Determine the exponential regression equation that best represents this data. Rounding parameters to nearest hundreth. Sketch the graph, label axes. Note that the $a$ parameter will be a very small number and the calculator will express it in scientific notation. In scientific notation a number expressed as <tt>1.2345E-10</tt> on the calculator is the same as $1.2345 \times 10^{-10} = 0.00000000012345$ (a very small number).</li>
      <li>According to the exponential regression function, at what rate, to the nearest percent, is the temperature increasing every year.</li>
      <li>Using your regression equation, estimate when the temperature will exceed 1.5 C$^{\circ}$ above the pre-industrial levels. Round your answer to the nearest year.</li>
      <li>Using your regression function, estimate the temperature anomaly in ten years from todays date.</li>

            <li>Domain: $\{t | 0 \leq t \leq 164, t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ Range: $\{e | 0 \leq e \leq 34755.2262, e \in \mathbb{R} \}$.</li>
            <li>The answer to this question will depend on your birth year and today's date. If you were born in 2000, $t=2000-1850=150$ and the emission in that year were $e(150) = 260 \times 1.0303^{150} \Rightarrow e(150)=22883.8094$ megatonnes. If today's year is 2019, $t=2019-1850=169$ and the emission are $e(169) = 260 \times 1.0303^{169} \Rightarrow e(150)=40349.54284$ megatonnes. Using the provided formula, $\displaystyle\frac{40349.54284 - 22883.8094}{22883.8094} \times 100 = 76.3235...$. The CO₂ emissions are projected to have increased 76% between the years 2000 and 2019.
            <li>The prediction is an extrapolation since the model is used to predict the emissions beyond the years for which it was calibrated (1850-2014). Caution needs to be taken when interpreting predictions based on extrapolation as the assumption one is making is that the trend described by the function continues beyond the data that was used to create the function. </li>
