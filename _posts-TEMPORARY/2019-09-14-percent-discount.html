<p>The regular price of a book is $\$24.50$. As an employee of the store, you get a 20% discount. How much would you pay for the book with your employee discount?</p>

          Let $x$ be the amount of discount you recieve on the book (in dollars), then when can use proportional reasoning to determine $x$ as follows, $\displaystyle\frac{part}{whole} \Rightarrow \displaystyle\frac{20}{100} = \displaystyle\frac{x}{24.50}$. By multiplying left and right hand side by 24.50 we get $x = \displaystyle\frac{20}{100} \times 24.50 = 4.90$. As an employee you get a discount of $\$4.90$ which means that you will be paying $\$19.60$ for the book ($24.50-4.90$).
