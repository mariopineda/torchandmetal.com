<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that caused the 2020 coronavirus outbreak. In less than two months the outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people across China, left more than a thousand dead, and spread to dozens of other countries. The number of infected people during the first five weeks of the 2020 outbreak can be modelled with the following exponential function $I(d) = 282 (1.165)^d$ where $d$ represents the number of days since January 19, 2020 ($d=0$) and $I(d)$ represents the number of diagnosed infected people.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>How many people were diagnosed to be infected with the corona virus on January 19?</li>
  <li>What was the daily growth rate?</li>
  <li>How many people were infected on February 23 (January has 31 days)?</li>
  <li>How long did it take, to the nearest day, for 10000 people to become infected?</li>
</ol>
