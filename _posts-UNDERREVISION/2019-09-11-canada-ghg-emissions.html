<p>Climate change is one of the most important environmental issues of our time. Climate change is caused by the increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These increases are primarily due to human activities such as the use of fossil fuels or agriculture. The following table summarizes the total GHG emissions in Canada between 1990 and 2017.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Determine the linear regression equation, rounding parameters to nearest hundreth. Sketch the graph, labelling axes with description and units.</li>
      <li>Using the regression function, estimate the GHG emissions in 2012, rounded to the nearest hundreth.</li>
      <li>The actual GHG emissions in 2012 were 711 megatonnes. Why is this different from your answer in b.</li>
      <li> Use your regression function to estimate the year, to the nearest year, in which the emissions would exceed 800 megatonnes if the same trend continues.</li>
